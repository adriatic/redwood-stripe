# Part 2: Subscription Management

Welcome to part 2. In part 1, we put together an application that allows users to signup as seller or regular customer. And we made sellers to pick and choose one of the 2 subscription our platform offers. In this part we will create a page for the seller to manage his subscription.

## Create a new manage subscription page

```bash
yarn rw generate page ManageSubscription
```

TODO:
x g cell Product
x g page CreateProduct
- Homepage with products / category
