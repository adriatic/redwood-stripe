# Intro

**Who never wanted to build a marketplace for [fill in the blank]?**

The goal of this tutorial is do that using redwood and stripe, if you want the low down about redwood, spend 100 seconds watching [this video](https://youtu.be/o5Mwa_TJ3HM) and if you are left wondering, but why redwood rather than some other framework? Then, I suggest you look at the [why redwood rather than some other framework?](https://community.redwoodjs.com/t/but-why-redwood-rather-than-some-other-framework-remix-blitz-vue-nextjs-gatsby-sveltekit-11ty-nuxtjs/2957) page! Basically Redwoodjs is your medicine against js tech stack fatigue.

The goal of this tutorial is to create a boilerplate application that is using the stripe API to build a marketplace with subscriptions. Yes, each seller is going to need to buy a subscription to be able to sell on our platform. We're a greedy bunch. Note that this tutorial is not about making things pretty, this is a 0 css tutorial, it might hurt your eyes, and a good remedy for that would be to us Chakra-ui that I highly recommend and fits very nicely with [Redwood](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/cli-commands#setup-ui) ‚ù§Ô∏è.

Note: We'll be using Typescript for this tutorial, doesn't mean that you have to use it. You could strip out the typescript parts and use the `yarn create redwood-app` without the `--ts` option, I won't judge you. Other people might...
